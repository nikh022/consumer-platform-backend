# Farmer-to-Consumer Discovery Platform Backend

A free discovery platform for **consumers** and **farmers**. 


## About
**Farmer-to-Consumer Discovery Platform** is a free discovery and connection platform where farmers can list their available products such as crops, vegetables, and fruits. Consumers can find nearby farmers based on location and product availability, and connect directly with sellers via phone calls or WhatsApp.
 
Our vision is to connect farmers directly with consumers to provide fresh, local produce without middlemen, thereby increasing farmers’ profits and ensuring fair prices.
